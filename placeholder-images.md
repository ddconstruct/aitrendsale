# Product Images

This directory should contain your product images. For a complete website, you'll need to create or source the following images:

1. `product-guide.jpg` - Image for the AI Productivity Guide
2. `product-masterclass.jpg` - Image for the Prompt Engineering Masterclass
3. `product-toolkit.jpg` - Image for the Business AI Toolkit

## Suggested Image Specifications

For optimal display on your website:

- **Dimensions**: 800px Ã— 600px (4:3 ratio)
- **Format**: JPG or WebP (for better compression)
- **File size**: Keep under 200KB per image for fast loading
- **Style**: Professional, clean images that represent each product

## Image Placeholder Options

Until you have your final product images, you can:

1. **Use stock photos**: Sites like Unsplash, Pexels, or Pixabay offer free images
2. **Create mockups**: Use tools like Canva to create product cover images
3. **Use AI-generated images**: Tools like Midjourney can create concept images
4. **Use the placeholder service**: Keep the current code that points to placeholder.com

## Example of Placeholder URLs

If you prefer to use online placeholders temporarily, you can use these in your HTML:

```html
