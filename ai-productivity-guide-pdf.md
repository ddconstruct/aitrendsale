# AI Productivity Guide 2025

*This file serves as a placeholder for the actual AI Productivity Guide PDF that you would create or convert from the previously generated content.*

When setting up your GitHub repository, you would:

1. Create a folder named `products/`
2. Convert this Markdown content to a PDF (using a tool like Pandoc, online converter, or export from Google Docs/Word)
3. Save the PDF as `products/guide.pdf`

## Converting the Previous Content to PDF

To create your actual product PDF:

1. Use the content from the previously generated "AI Productivity Guide 2025" artifact
2. Format it in Word, Google Docs, or a similar word processor
3. Add any additional images, charts, or formatting to enhance the value
4. Export as a PDF
5. Place in your `products/` directory

## Sample Delivery Mechanism

In a production environment, after a successful PayPal payment, you would either:

1. Automatically redirect the customer to a temporary download URL
2. Email the customer a protected download link
3. Provide access to a members-only area with the download

Your `scripts.js` file would need to be updated to handle this delivery mechanism.
