# Digital Products

This directory should contain your digital products for delivery. For your e-commerce website, you'll need to create:

## Required Files

1. `guide.pdf` - The AI Productivity Guide 2025
2. `masterclass.pdf` - The AI Prompt Engineering Masterclass
3. `toolkit.pdf` - The AI for Business Toolkit

## Product Creation

You can create these products using the content previously generated in this conversation:

1. Copy the content from the artifacts created earlier
2. Format them professionally in Google Docs, Microsoft Word, or other document software
3. Add any additional images, charts, diagrams, and formatting to enhance the value
4. Export as PDFs with appropriate metadata and bookmarks

## Security Considerations

For a production website, consider these security measures:

1. **Don't store products directly in public GitHub repository**
   - Use private storage solutions like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or similar
   - Set up proper authentication for downloads

2. **Protect download links**
   - Generate temporary signed URLs that expire
   - Limit download attempts per purchase
   - Use a download management system

3. **Watermark documents**
   - Include the buyer's information in delivered PDFs (can be automated)
   - Add transaction IDs to trace any unauthorized sharing

## Delivery Options

Several approaches to deliver your digital products:

1. **Manual delivery**: Process PayPal notifications and email products manually
2. **Semi-automated**: Use PayPal IPN (Instant Payment Notification) to trigger emails with download links
3. **Fully automated**: Integrate with services like SendOwl, Easy Digital Downloads, or Gumroad
4. **Membership site**: Grant access to a protected content area after purchase

## Recommended Format

For the best customer experience:

- Include clickable table of contents
- Use consistent branding and formatting
- Optimize file size without sacrificing quality
- Test on multiple devices to ensure readability
