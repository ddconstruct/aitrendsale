# Product Images

This directory should contain your product images. For a complete website, you'll need to create or source the following images:

1. `product-guide.jpg` - Image for the AI Productivity Guide
2. `product-masterclass.jpg` - Image for the Prompt Engineering Masterclass
3. `product-toolkit.jpg` - Image for the Business AI Toolkit

## Suggested Image Specifications

For optimal display on your website:

- **Dimensions**: 800px Ã— 600px (4:3 ratio)
- **Format**: JPG or WebP (for better compression)
- **File size**: Keep under 200KB per image for fast loading
- **Style**: Professional, clean images that represent each product

## Image Placeholder Options

Until you have your final product images, you can:

1. **Use stock photos**: Sites like Unsplash, Pexels, or Pixabay offer free images
2. **Create mockups**: Use tools like Canva to create product cover images
3. **Use AI-generated images**: Tools like Midjourney can create concept images
4. **Use the placeholder service**: Keep the current code that points to placeholder.com

## Example of Placeholder URLs

If you prefer to use online placeholders temporarily, you can use these in your HTML:

```html
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x600/4a6fff/ffffff?text=AI+Productivity+Guide" alt="AI Productivity Guide">
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x600/8a63e9/ffffff?text=Prompt+Engineering" alt="AI Prompt Engineering Masterclass">
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x600/ff6b6b/ffffff?text=Business+AI+Toolkit" alt="AI for Business Toolkit">
```

## Creating a Consistent Brand Look

For a professional appearance:

1. Use a consistent color scheme that matches your website design
2. Include your logo on all product images
3. Use similar layout and design elements across all products
4. Consider creating 3D mockups of your digital products (e.g., showing the guide as a book or course)

Remember that high-quality images significantly impact conversion rates for digital products.
